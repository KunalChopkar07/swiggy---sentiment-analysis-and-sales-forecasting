Project Phases:

- Data Extraction and Cleaning:
  - Scraped and collected real-time customer review data, order history, and restaurant information.
  - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Requests for extraction and initial processing.
  - Cleaned and transformed the data using advanced Excel functions and Python to remove null values, fix formatting inconsistencies, and structure it for analysis.

- Sentiment Analysis using NLP:
  - Built an NLP model using libraries like NLTK and TextBlob to classify customer reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories.
  - Achieved a sentiment classification accuracy of over 85%, enabling deeper understanding of customer satisfaction patterns across different restaurants and areas.

- Sales Forecasting with Time Series Modeling:
  - Applied time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future food delivery demand.
  - Achieved a forecasting accuracy of 95%, providing critical insights into expected order volumes during peak seasons and normal periods.

- Data Visualization using Power BI:
  - Created dynamic dashboards to visualize sentiment trends, popular cuisines, customer satisfaction by area, and forecasted sales.
  - Integrated slicers for area-wise, cuisine-wise, and sentiment-wise exploration to enhance interactivity.
