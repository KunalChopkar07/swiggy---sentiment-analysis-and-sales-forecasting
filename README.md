## Project Description üìÉ:

In this project, we dive deep into Swiggy‚Äôs ecosystem, combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and advanced analytics to extract meaningful insights from customer feedback and predict future demand.

Project Phases:

- Data Extraction and Cleaning:
  - Scraped and collected real-time customer review data, order history, and restaurant information.
  - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Requests for extraction and initial processing.
  - Cleaned and transformed the data using advanced Excel functions and Python to remove null values, fix formatting inconsistencies, and structure it for analysis.

- Sentiment Analysis using NLP:
  - Built an NLP model using libraries like NLTK and TextBlob to classify customer reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories.
  - Achieved a sentiment classification accuracy of over 85%, enabling deeper understanding of customer satisfaction patterns across different restaurants and areas.

- Sales Forecasting with Time Series Modeling:
  - Applied time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future food delivery demand.
  - Achieved a forecasting accuracy of 95%, providing critical insights into expected order volumes during peak seasons and normal periods.

- Data Visualization using Power BI:
  - Created dynamic dashboards to visualize sentiment trends, popular cuisines, customer satisfaction by area, and forecasted sales.
  - Integrated slicers for area-wise, cuisine-wise, and sentiment-wise exploration to enhance interactivity.
